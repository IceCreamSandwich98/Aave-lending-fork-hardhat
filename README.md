# Foobar

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

I use yarn rather than npm, but both get the job done.

```bash
yarn
```

```bash
yarn hardhat
```

```bash
yarn add --dev @aave/protocol-v2
```

```bash
yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle chai ethereum-waffle hardhat hardhat-contract-sizer hardhat-deploy hardhat-gas-reporter prettier prettier-plugin-solidity solhint solidity-coverage dotenv

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
